# Some notes while learning about A-frame

These are my notes,
taken while learning about A-frame.
Maybe they could be useful to others,
but your mileage may vary...

In any case,
feel free to pull request if you find errors,
or if you have cool ideas to improve some of the steps.
But keep in mind that it is just a simple guide,
to start with A-frame from scratch.

I started with version 0.6.1, which was current when I started
my learning process, but now all should be updated to using 0.9.2.

Now, the notes:

* figures-01: [First steps in creating an A-frame scene](figures-01/README.md)
* moving-01: [Adding objects with animations](moving-01/README.md)
* data-01: [Visualizing data](data-01/README.md)
* data-02: [Visualizing data with components](data-02/README.md)
* data-03: [Visualizing data (fully componentized)](data-03/README.md)
* data-04: [Visualizing data (JSON documents)](data-04/README.md)
* interaction-01: [Learning to move](interaction-01/README.md)
* interaction-02: [Selecting objects](interaction-02/README.md)
* physics-01: [Adding some physics](physics-01/README.md)
* physics-02: [A camara respecting (some) physics](physics-02/README.md)
* camrender-01: [Cameras and screens](camrender-01/README.md)
* camrender-02: [More and more screens!](camrender-02/README.md)
* camrender-03: [Making it components](camrender-03/README.md)
* ar-01: [Augmented reality](ar-01/README.md)
* newyear-01: [Scene for greeting the new year](newyear-01/README.md)

Some of the code used in the examples is available as [A-Frame reusable components](components),
which you can just include in your code.

While I was learning about A-Frame, I was also learning about Webpack,
and I took some notes:

* webpack/figures-02: [Simple configuration for webpack](figures-02/README.md)
* webpack/figures-03: [Improving webpack configuration](figures-03/README.md)
* webpack/figures-04: [Adding a complex object](figures-04/README.md)


I have also produced a
[templates directory](templates/README.md),
which I'm using as I learn about A-frame and webpack and npm and all the stuff.


Some old stuff, that very likely won't even work:

* [Some 3D plots](plots-01/README.md)
* [Playing towards my 3D scatterplots](plots-02/README.md)
* [Adding axis and tooltips](plots-03/README.md)

All the code is in the
[A-Frame Playground GitHub repo](https://github.com/jgbarah/aframe-playground).
